# SizeUnits

Just a simple alternative to the activesupport helpers if you don't want to
add activesupport as dependency to your gem/application.

It works the same way:

```ruby
2.kilobytes
1.bytes
3.gigabytes
```



# Human size

Another activesupport alternative

```ruby
1500.human_size => "2 bytes"
```
